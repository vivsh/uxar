# Framework Benchmarks

This workspace member compares Vyuh against Axum, Rocket, Actix, FastAPI, and
DRF with two tiers:

- Tier 1: raw HTTP/API boundary with SQLite.
- Tier 2: Postgres-backed live operations app with scheduled rollups and live
  delivery.

Each framework implementation is intentionally a single application source file.
Shared SQL, seed data, load scripts, and reporting scripts are outside LOC
counts.

## Layout

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/bin/t1_*.rs` | Rust Tier 1 implementations |
| `src/bin/t2_*.rs` | Rust Tier 2 implementations |
| `python/t1_fastapi.py` and `python/t2_fastapi.py` | FastAPI implementations |
| `python/drf_t1/` and `python/drf_t2/` | Folder-based DRF implementations |
| `sql/t1_sqlite.sql` | Tier 1 schema and seed |
| `sql/t2_postgres.sql` | Tier 2 schema |
| `scripts/loc.py` | LOC counter for implementation files |
| `scripts/report.py` | Markdown summary generator |
| `results/raw/<timestamp>/` | Raw benchmark output |

## Running

Tier 1 Vyuh uses SQLite:

```sh
cargo run -p framework-bench --features vyuh-sqlite --bin t1_vyuh
```

Tier 2 Vyuh uses Postgres:

```sh
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/vyuh_bench \
cargo run -p framework-bench --features vyuh-postgres --bin t2_vyuh
```

Other Rust bins do not require Vyuh features:

```sh
cargo run -p framework-bench --bin t1_axum --release
cargo run -p framework-bench --bin t2_axum --release
```

Python dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Run Python apps with
production-style servers, no reload/debug mode:

```sh
uvicorn t1_fastapi:app --app-dir python --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
PYTHONPATH=python gunicorn drf_t1.wsgi:application --bind 127.0.0.1:8000
```

## Methodology

- Use the same machine, OS settings, Postgres version, Postgres config, seed
  data, and connection pool size.
- Recreate the database before each run.
- Run Rust apps as release binaries.
- Run Python apps as single-process/single-worker baselines first.
- Warm each server before measurement.
- Run each scenario at least five times and report median with min/max.
- Store raw JSON/CSV under `results/raw/<timestamp>/`.

Recommended scenarios:

- `GET /health` at concurrency `1`, `16`, `64`, `256`.
- Tier 1 `POST /echo` and `GET /items/{id}` at the same concurrency levels.
- Tier 2 read, write, live-subscribe, and mixed workloads.
- Tier 2 scheduler drift while write and live-subscribe workloads are active.

## LOC Rules

Count only each single app source file, except DRF where the app folder is
counted because that is Django's natural project shape. Exclude comments, blank
lines, shared SQL, seed data, harness scripts, and reporting scripts. Report:

- total implementation LOC,
- scheduler/live-delivery LOC,
- add-on dependencies needed to match the feature set.

## Interpreting Results

The comparison should separate two claims:

- Tier 1 shows raw web boundary overhead, where Vyuh should track close to Axum
  because Vyuh is a thin Axum layer.
- Tier 2 shows framework surface area for scheduled work, signals/fanout,
  channels/live delivery, operation metadata, and introspection.
